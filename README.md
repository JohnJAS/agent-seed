# Agent Seed

This repository contains the source and release tooling for the `agent-seed` Codex skill.

`agent-seed` distills repository evidence and owner knowledge into executable agent runbooks, review checkpoints, and project-local guidance. Its goal is to seed a codebase with the knowledge coding agents need to develop in safe self-directed loops while humans focus on review, approval, and the few decisions that require project-owner judgment.

```

The release package is built from `skill/` only. Root-level files such as this README, `Makefile`, and `tools/` are maintainer assets and are not copied into the published skill artifact. The `skill/` directory name is intentionally generic: it is the release package source root, so its contents become the top level of the published `agent-seed` skill.

## What The Skill Produces

- `AGENTS.md` as a concise project entry point for future agents.
- Focused `agents.d/` runbooks for bootstrap, tooling, architecture, change recipes, debugging, review handoff, risks, and missing context.
- Optional platform-specific files such as `CLAUDE.md` or project-local skills when the owner uses those platforms.
- Recommended external plugin guidance from configuration, using each platform's normal network-backed install flow instead of vendoring plugin internals.
- Automation breakpoints and human review checkpoints that clarify when an agent can keep looping and when it must stop for approval.
- Framework fingerprints for common, private, vendor, or internally named frameworks so agents do not guess at framework behavior.
- Built-in and project-local framework knowledge routing, starting with a Nuwa preset that improves scans and owner interviews without treating preset knowledge as confirmed project facts.

## Requirements

- Node.js with the built-in `node:test` runner.
- GNU Make for the convenience targets.
- Windows PowerShell available as `powershell`, used by the release script to create the zip archive with .NET compression APIs.

On Windows, install Make with Chocolatey if it is not already available. Run PowerShell as Administrator, install Chocolatey, then install Make:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
choco install make
```

## Common Commands

Run the release test:

```sh
make check
```

Build the expanded release directory and zip package:

```sh
make release
```

Equivalent direct commands:

```sh
node --test tools/release.test.mjs
node tools/release.mjs
```

## Release Artifacts

`make release` writes:

```text
outputs/agent-seed/
outputs/agent-seed.zip
```

The expanded directory is useful for inspection. The zip file is the distributable artifact. The zip root contains `SKILL.md` directly, not an extra nested wrapper directory.

## Bundled Packages

### `git-code-tracker`

- Version: `v1.0.1`
- Source: `https://github.com/yooocen/git-code-tracker.git`
- Ref: `refs/tags/v1.0.1`
- Commit: `e1cc62d9fb3f82e2f13ca276be94ce5fcdaf6aa9`
- Package path: `skill/packages/git-code-tracker`
- Project-local installer: `node skill/packages/git-code-tracker/install-to-project.js <target-project>`

Do not run the installer without explicit approval. It may write `.opencode/`, `.claude/`, `.git/hooks`, `.ai-tracking`, `.gitignore`, and `AGENTS.md` in the target project.

## Development Notes

- Edit source files under `skill/`.
- Do not edit generated files under `outputs/`.
- Keep bundled direct skills registered in `skill/bundled-skills.json`.
- Keep bundled packages registered in `skill/bundled-packages.json`.
- Keep recommended external plugins registered in `skill/external-plugins.json`.
- Keep framework knowledge registered in `skill/framework-knowledge.json`; place built-in framework packs under `skill/references/frameworks/`.
- Run `make release` before publishing changes so the test and package build both exercise the current tree.
